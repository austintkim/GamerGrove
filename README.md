  - browse games that are already loaded into the site by platform and
   genre

   user-written reviews, etc.)
  - search for more games by keyword (will automatically be added to
   website's database)
  - click on a link to purchase the game on the platform of their choice

- Users can (in addition to the above):
  - create/update/delete an account
  - create/update/delete a board to which they can add games
  - add/remove games to their wishlist
  - write/update/delete reviews for a game
