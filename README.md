## Intended market
We are targeting gamer enthusiasts who are looking for an easy and user-friendly way to organize, procure, inspect, and collaborate on games they have interest in.

## Functionality
- Visitors to the site can:
  - browse games that are pre-loaded into the site by platform and
   genre
  - view the details of any game (i.e. description, screenshots, ratings,
   user-written reviews, etc.)
  - search for more games by keyword (will automatically be added to
   website's database)
  - click on a link to purchase the game on the platform of their choice

- Users can (in addition to the above):
  - create/update/delete an account
  - create/update/delete a board to which they can add games
  - add/remove games to their wishlist
  - write/update/delete reviews for a game
  - upvote/downvote reviews for a game
  - can access any of the above features from either a user dashboard or
   an 'options' pointer menu
